It is a Node-Typescript-Helix app which uses GraphQL paradigm for its apis.
- It involves Query, Mutation, Context, Resolvers, Subscriptions, Pub/Sub
- I've used SQLite Database & Prisma Client for CRUD.
- I've also exposed apis for signup, login, post, upvote with authentication(jwt).
- I'm working on creating realtime subscriptions in GraphQL.
- Feed query has filtering implemented.
